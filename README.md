# Portfolio
This is my portfolio website that I will be handcrafting from scratch as a final project for a class. It's intention is internship application. I will be making another website, along with this one, so this will be my third website created with the intention of publication.

My initial introduction to this project has left me feeling a little unprepared. As a student who consistently works two jobs while going to school full time, I won't really have time to fix, adjust, or create any projects for my portfolio. I've had many technical errors throughout the past few years that have left me with pieces of content here and there from previous projects whether they be school related or personal. This means I can't make small adjustments to these projects without reconstructing them completely. I have some, like my first game. Drawing some characters, sketching some poses, and expressing my current personal projects is possible from time to time. But the bigger projects that I've wanted to fix for a while, like my first game I've ever created, aren't going to be doable beyond simple fixes of coding errors and possibly some inanimate assets. I do want to attempt to do this, simply to showcase where I'm truly currently capable of. We'll see how this goes! I do enjoy creating websites, so that's the positive outlook I'm going to have! One step at a time, that's all it is.
