            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> 
                Hello! My name is Mackenzie Burt, I typically go by Kenzie or Kove. I'm a diversified 2D concept artist and
                animator that's pursuing a unique degree called GIMM that focuses on game design! I specialize in making
                characters and stories that people can relate to. My most apparent interest is that of the player community
                itself. I strive to provide and help build projects and interactive content that allows others to not only
                enjoy themselves, but perhaps even learn from the experience they are provided and influence. I think that
                a lot of people these days struggle with mental health, and I truly believe that interactive media and video
                games in general are an incredible way to help people connect with each other and escape the things that
                negatively impact them.
                I'm a very bubbly and positive individual and I particularly enjoy making others laugh. I learn very quickly,
                but the best way for me to learn is getting thrown into the chaos. I thrive with or without structure, and
                tend to work harder when I'm overwhelmed. I've always worked two jobs while going to University full time,
                I can handle a lot of pressure and a lot of tasks. I've typically worked in service my entire life, so socializing
                is something that I enjoy and this is quite helpful in relation to working on projects that require multiple
                people.
                In summary, if you want a social artist with a unique experience and perspective, I'm your girl!

            <p>This piece is actually based upon Akara. My partner did not do very much with this assignment, it was more
                so an 80/20 split.
                This is why it looks so rushed and sloppy, I ended up doing the entire thing in one night, more so 80% of
                the project once you throw in backgrounds. I'm not proud of it, but I'm not ashamed of it either.
                This assignment also taught me how to work with other animators. We had a lack of communcation early on, which
                was on both of us,
                but in the end it worked out and we both learned from it.
