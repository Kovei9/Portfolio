        <h1>About My Degree</h1>
        <p>I'm a student in GIMM at Boise State University (GIMM - Games, Interactive Media, Mobile).
            I'm an artist, and I've specialized in 2D digital mediums for over a decade. From concept art, to character design, even 2D animation, I've always enjoyed having multiple skills at my finger tips.
            That's why I chose GIMM. The program isn't your typical Game Design degree. It teaches you Web Development, Web and Graphic Design, while also allowing students to learn and use at least 6 different coding languages.
            However, the most crucial aspect of GIMM is how the program teaches its students. We are handed a medium, and a task, with basic knowledge provided from our professors. We as students are then required to figure out how to complete the task on our own. Of course there is help available,
            but my first platformer, located within School Projects, was a game that I created with absolutely no previous knowledge of programming or using Unity.
            Within the first month, I was learning the language and starting to write my own lines of code without any aid from other sources. This is something I believe would not have been
            achievable for me in any other program. The degree itself teaches you how to think and work like a developer and designer working in the industry. As a junior, I will be creating a game over the course of the next 2 semesters. The only base requirement is that the game has 3D elements. The rest is up to my creative insperation.
            My senior year, I will be working with actual clients for both semesters. This is to help us learn how to work with clients and how to create a product that meets their needs and wants. I'm excited to see where my journey in GIMM will take me, and I'm excited to share my work with you all.

        <h1> Why Game Design? </h1>
        <p> Games were a huge factor in my childhood. Without them, I wouldn't be who I am today. The way that a game impacts the player is an experience that cannot be felt with any other medium. If you watch a horror movie, or read a horror book, you may feel uncomfortable and perhaps a little anxious. But nothing compares to playing a horror game.
            The way your skin crawls, the way you panic, the pressure, the intensity. The same could be said for other genres. The way a game can make you feel is something that I want to be able to provide for others. I want to create and work on games that people can enjoy, that they can learn from, and that they can feel. I want to create games that can change the way people think, and the way they feel. I want to create games that can change the world, the way they changed my world.
            What better way can I, as an artist, help others?

        </p>
        <h1> Why YOU?</h1>
        <p> I'm a very positive individual. I'm also a fun addition to any work space, as I enjoy making my coworkers laugh and enjoy themselves. I'm not a predictable individual, and this is helpful when bouncing ideas around for concepts that are work related. I'm also oddly good at solving problems, even issues that I may not understand myself.
            When it comes to creating characters, or worlds, or even games, I have a rare ability to heavily relate and emphathize with my own creations. I don't simply create things, I create living, breathing entities that have their own stories and lives that I create from my own experiences. This is something that I believe is a rare trait in the industry, and I believe it's something that can help me stand out.
