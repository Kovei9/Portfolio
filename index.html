    <h1>Mackenzie Burt's Portfolio</h1>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Mackenzie Burt, I typically go by Kenzie or Kove. I'm a diversified 2D concept artist and animator
        that's pursuing a unique degree called GIMM that focuses on game design! I specialize in making characters and
        stories that people can relate to. My most apparent interest is that of the player community itself. I strive to
        provide and help build projects and interactive content that allows others to not only enjoy themselves, but
        perhaps even learn from the experience they are provided and influence. I think that a lot of people these days
        struggle with mental health, and I truly believe that interactive media and video games in general are an
        incredible way to help people connect with each other and escape the things that negatively impact them.
        I'm a very bubbly and positive individual and I particularly enjoy making others laugh. I learn very quickly,
        but the best way for me to learn is getting thrown into the chaos. I thrive with or without structure, and tend
        to work harder when I'm overwhelmed. I've always worked two jobs while going to University full time, I can
        handle a lot of pressure and a lot of tasks. I've typically worked in service my entire life, so socializing is
        something that I enjoy and this is quite helpful in relation to working on projects that require multiple
        people.
        In summary, if you want a social artist with a unique experience and perspective, I'm your girl!

    <h2>My First Game</h2>
    <p>Typically, I wouldn't sit here and explain why something is so... disappointing. But in this instance, it's
        important because this example is simply here to show my growth in abilities.

    <p>This piece is actually based upon Akara. My partner did not do very much with this assignment, it was more so an
        80/20 split.
        This is why it looks so rushed and sloppy, I ended up doing the entire thing in one night, more so 80% of the
        project once you throw in backgrounds. I'm not proud of it, but I'm not ashamed of it either.
        I learned a lot from this assignment, and I'm glad I did it, particularly what I'm capable of when I'm on a time
        crunch artistically.
        This assignment also taught me how to work with other animators. We had a lack of communication early on, which was
        on both of us, but in the end it worked out and we both learned from it.
