            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> 
                Hello! My name is Mackenzie Burt, I typically go by Kenzie or Kove. I'm a diversified 2D concept artist and
                animator that's pursuing a unique degree called GIMM that focuses on game design! I specialize in making
                characters and stories that people can relate to. My most apparent interest is that of the player community
                itself. I strive to provide and help build projects and interactive content that allows others to not only
                enjoy themselves, but perhaps even learn from the experience they are provided and influence. I think that
                a lot of people these days struggle with mental health, and I truly believe that interactive media and video
                games in general are an incredible way to help people connect with each other and escape the things that
                negatively impact them.
                I'm a very bubbly and positive individual and I particularly enjoy making others laugh. I learn very quickly,
                but the best way for me to learn is getting thrown into the chaos. I thrive with or without structure, and
                tend to work harder when I'm overwhelmed. I've always worked two jobs while going to University full time,
                I can handle a lot of pressure and a lot of tasks. I've typically worked in service my entire life, so socializing
                is something that I enjoy and this is quite helpful in relation to working on projects that require multiple
                people.
                In summary, if you want a social artist with a unique experience and perspective, I'm your girl!
            </p>
