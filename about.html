                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Mackenzie Burt, I typically go by Kenzie or Kove. I'm a diversified 2D concept artist and
                    animator that's pursuing a unique degree called GIMM that focuses on game design! I specialize in making
                    characters and stories that people can relate to. My most apparent interest is that of the player community
                    itself. I strive to provide and help build projects and interactive content that allows others to not only
                    enjoy themselves, but perhaps even learn from the experience they are provided and influence. I think that
                    a lot of people these days struggle with mental health, and I truly believe that interactive media and video
                    games in general are an incredible way to help people connect with each other and escape the things that
                    negatively impact them.
                    I'm a very bubbly and positive individual and I particularly enjoy making others laugh. I learn very quickly,
                    but the best way for me to learn is getting thrown into the chaos. I thrive with or without structure, and
                    tend to work harder when I'm overwhelmed. I've always worked two jobs while going to University full time,
                    I can handle a lot of pressure and a lot of tasks. I've typically worked in service my entire life, so socializing
                    is something that I enjoy and this is quite helpful in relation to working on projects that require multiple
                    people.
                    In summary, if you want a social artist with a unique experience and perspective, I'm your girl!</p>
