                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a passionate 3D modeler and animator, driven by a deep love for storytelling and visual design. My creative journey has been shaped by diverse experiences in game development, graphic design, and interactive media, spanning tools like Unity, Unreal Engine, Blender, and Maya. With a strong foundation in artistic principles and a dedication to continuous learning, I strive to craft visuals and experiences that resonate emotionally and immerse audiences fully.

                    While I have explored front-end and back-end web development, UX/UI interfaces, and six programming languages, my true strength lies in transforming imaginative ideas into compelling, relatable creations. Whether building characters, environments, or interactive stories, I bring a collaborative spirit and a relentless curiosity to every project.
                    
                    Let’s create something unforgettable, together.</p>

    <h2>GIMM: A Degree Built for Innovators</h2>
   <p> GIMM (Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile) is not your typical academic program. Founded in 2016 by Anthony Ellertson, it’s a fast-paced, multidisciplinary degree that thrives on chaos and creativity. Designed for anyone with a passion for interactive media—whether in game design, UX/UI, VR, or beyond—GIMM transforms raw curiosity into real-world expertise.
    
    The program immerses students in everything from 3D modeling and animation to graphic design, audio production, app development, and even full-stack web development. It is an education where artists and developers become both sides of one coin, learning how to be both a developer and an artist. With almost no exams and a focus on hands-on projects, every course pushes you to solve problems in real time, often with little prior knowledge. It’s an environment that teaches through doing, forcing you to adapt, collaborate, and create with the only constraint being time.
    
    As a capstone, students build a fully functioning VR game, creating everything from scratch—assets, code, music, and mechanics—over two years. This isn’t just education; it’s an intense, industry-relevant experience that sharpens your ability to think critically, lead effectively, and thrive under pressure.
    
    GIMM isn’t for the faint of heart, but for those who embrace challenges, problems, and the unknown, it’s transformative.
