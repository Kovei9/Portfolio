                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Mackenzie Burt, I typically go by Kenzie or Kove. I'm a diversified 2D concept
                    artist and
                    animator that's pursuing a unique degree called GIMM that focuses on game design! I specialize in
                    making
                    characters and stories that people can relate to. My most apparent interest is that of the player
                    community
                    itself. I strive to provide and help build projects and interactive content that allows others to
                    not only
                    enjoy themselves, but perhaps even learn from the experience they are provided and influence. I
                    think that
                    a lot of people these days struggle with mental health, and I truly believe that interactive media
                    and video
                    games in general are an incredible way to help people connect with each other and escape the things
                    that
                    negatively impact them.
                    I'm a very bubbly and positive individual and I particularly enjoy making others laugh. I learn very
                    quickly,
                    but the best way for me to learn is getting thrown into the chaos. I thrive with or without
                    structure, and
                    tend to work harder when I'm overwhelmed. I've always worked two jobs while going to University full
                    time,
                    I can handle a lot of pressure and a lot of tasks. I've typically worked in service my entire life,
                    so socializing
                    is something that I enjoy and this is quite helpful in relation to working on projects that require
                    multiple
                    people.
                    In summary, if you want a social artist with a unique experience and perspective, I'm your girl!</p>

        <h2>GIMM. What is it?</h2>
        <p>GIMM stands for Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile. It was founded by Anthony Ellertson in 2016, and its first class graduated in 2019.
            GIMM is one of the most unique degrees in the country. It's a degree that focuses on game design, but it's not just for game designers. It's for anyone who wants to work in the game industry, or any industry that uses interactive media.
            Graphic design, UX design, Web design, virtual reality, augmented reality, mobile app development, video editing, music. These are just a few of the wide variety of required courses within this degree.
            As seniors, your final project is a virtual reality game. You create your own music, your own 3D assets, your own code, and completely your own idea and turn it into a functioning game. You start this project in the second semester of your Sophmore year, and continue to build off of it using multiple courses until your senior capstone.
            Each class has multiple projects, the entire degree actually only has one exam within the Physical Computing course where you learn the basics of open-source software development. The rest of the grading system is based entirely off of personal assignments and group assignments.
            Each course typically has a minimum of one group project. The degree is structured to teach students how to work in the industry before you graduate. We are molded into game designers from the minute we walk in the doors.
            I have never learned anything so quickly than I have within this program. So far, after three semesters, I have basic knowledge of over five coding languages with no prior experience. I created functioning projects with each language and frequently a combination of them.
            This program has tuaght me so much within a small three semesters. I'm not your typical game designer, I'm an incredibly diversified individual with the ability to work in multiple fields thanks to my education. Frequently, I will question whether or not I will enjoy a course based upon my skill set and my intentions for my future. I have yet to be disappointed by a course, and I have yet to be disappointed by the knowledge I have gained from this program.
            Every course, I discover new interests. I never thought that I would ever enjoy coding or web design, but here I am designing this website and enjoying every second of it. I can't wait to see where I am in two years, I'm so thankful for my incredible Professors and the opportunities that this program has given me.</p>
