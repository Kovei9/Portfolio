        <h1>Akara: My longest standing Character.</h1>
        <p>Here, I'm going to take you through the five year process of this character, her development, and my quick improvement within character design and world-building.</p>

                <p>This is the original concept I had for Akara. The 'comic pages' were created May 25th of 2019. The 'Species chart'
                    was created May 18th of 2019. I was creating a world where 'humans' had evolved into animal hybrids.
                    Akara was a 'leopard hybrid'. As you can tell, these characters were incredibly colorful. I change this significantly later.

                <img id="img-fluid side-by-side" src="Images and Videos\akaraconcept4.png" alt="Original3">
                <p>This was a big turning point for Akara, because I completely changed her powers from electricity to fire.
                    This set me up for the massive structure of her storyline, the plot of her character development, and her world as a whole.
                    At this point, they were still more so animals than humans. This was simply because I was still learning how to draw humans.
                    This was from August 13th 2019.

                <p> These new sketches were created September 13th in 2021. Two years later! I was finally
                    testing the waters with expressions, new forms of clothing, and starting to form my own style.
                    I was also starting to improve with human anatomy, and therefore we see a significant change
                    in the way these characters are structured.

            <p>This drawing is from Febuary 7th, 2022. This was a really important moment for me, and to this day I still love this image.
                It allowed me to realize how far I had come in just two years of intentionally working on drawing humans.
                You can see how her muscles have grown quite significantly, even if the anatomy here is quite off.

                    I believe this is from 2023, but it could be 2022. It was my first real 'character sheet' for Akara. As I continued building the world around her,
                    I realized that I needed to start creating character sheets for the characters so I could keep track
                    of what kind of clothing they would wear, and their designs as a whole. I also needed to keep track of their powers, abilities, and personalities.

                <p>Finally I was able to draw Akara the way I wanted to. Muscular! This was in the summer of 2023.
                    I created an image of all my female characters together. Kiko is at Akara's side.
