                <p>This is the original concept I had for Akara. The 'comic pages' were created May 25th of 2019. The 'Species chart'
                    was created May 18th of 2019. I was creating a world where 'humans' had evolved into animal hybrids.
                    Akara was a 'leopard hybrid'. As you can tell, these characters were incredibly colorful. I change this significantly later.
                </p>

            <div class="container">

                    </div>
                    <p> These new sketches were created September 13th in 2021. Two years later! I was finally
                        testing the waters with expressions, new forms of clothing, and starting to form my own style.
                        I was also starting to improve with human anatomy, and therefore we see a significant change
                        in the way these characters are structured.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p>This drawing is from Febuary 7th, 2022. This was a really important moment for me, and to this day I still love this image.
                        It allowed me to realize how far I had come in just two years of intentionally working on drawing humans.
                        You can see how her muscles have grown quite significantly, even if the anatomy here is quite off.
                    </p>
                </div>
            
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-12">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="Images and Videos\Akara.jpg" alt="Akara">
                     
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        I believe this is from 2023, but it could be 2022. It was my first real 'character sheet' for Akara. As I continued building the world around her,
                        I realized that I needed to start creating character sheets for the characters so I could keep track
                        of what kind of clothing they would wear, and their designs as a whole. I also needed to keep track of their powers, abilities, and personalities.
                    </p>
                </div>
            
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-12">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="Images and Videos\akarakiko.png" alt="Akara2">
                       
                    </div>
                    <p>Finally I was able to draw Akara the way I wanted to. Muscular! This was in the summer of 2023.
                        I created an image of all my female characters together. Kiko is at Akara's side.
