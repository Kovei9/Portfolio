                </div>
                <p> The time period for the interaction of these characters takes place during the American Wild West era. Octavia is an african-american woman
                    who refuses to allow herself to be limmited by the small minds of others. She works as a maide for a rich man who owns a vast library.
                    After certain events leave her with nothing left to lose, she decides to take a chance and try to use one of the summoning books. She's succesful,
                    and Lilith is the result.

                        <img src="Images and Videos\Title Concept 1.jpg" alt="octavia" class="img-fluid">
                </div>
                <p>I came up with the concept that Lilith isn't actually a deity or monster, but rather,
                     she was a normal woman who was part of the Germanic Tribes during the time of the Roman Empire that happened to stumble upon a one in a million event.
                    She met her demise in a battle at a Wagon Fort, but with the assistance of some witchy cultists,
                    she was brought back to life in the "Well of Holiness". In truth, she underwent a molecular fusion with a bacterium called Deinococcus radiodurans
                    that was residing in their 'holy water'.
                    With her newfound ability to transform into other people, she seeks vengeance and causes the fall of Rome.
                    Of course, being immortal, whispers spread, and Lilith's name was created and spoken for centuries to come after some unforeseen events.
                    Magic does exist in this realm but I like science and combining the two concepts.
