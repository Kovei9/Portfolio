Typically, I wouldn't sit here and explain why something is so... dissapointing. But in this instance, it's important because
    this example is simply here to show my growth in abilities.
    This was the first time I ever coded. The first time I ever used Unity. The first time that I ever even really thought about
    creating a game.
    I had 2-3 months to finish this project. The requirements were simple. Have a functioning 2D platformer with specified game elements,
    a counting system, a double jump, etc. I had to have a trailer, and I had to have a playable game.
    My concept was a girl who was living in an apocalyptic world, she had a pet raccoon, the governing structure stole her raccoon,
    and she went to save the raccoon.
    I had so many ideas! So many things I wanted to do with this assignment! I wanted enemies with basic AI where they could follow the player,
    I wanted the enemies to be able to shoot at the player. I wanted a health bar, with multiple lives, and items that would give these lives back.
    I wanted two levels, one where she's outside breaking into the government facility, and one where she's inside of it and finds her raccoon. But then,
    I wanted a third level where you escape with the raccoon, which is now a robot!
    All I ended up being able to do was create an acid puddle where the player could die, and the ability for the player to pick up and throw grenades. She could also dash, and I recall
     getting very excited when I learned how to add a dash into the animator and how to make a button cause the player to dash. 
    I try not to look at my first game with distain or resentment. I believe it's an achievement. I learned how to do all of this in two months, with no prior experience.
    Before I had turned in this assignment, I actually had enemies that would shoot small bullets at the player. However, in the last two hours
    as I was finally figuring things out, I ended up not being able to get the bullets to trigger death for the character. So I scrapped probably
    four scripts and three assets. I regret this immensely. I could have easily built off of what I had, especially now with my current knowledge.

    I'm only explaining this to showcase that I had to learn to keep my goals achievable. I dream big. I love handing myself massive projects with big ideas.
    But knowing your skill level in comparison to your goals is incredibly important. It's also important to push your boundaries, and yourself,
    but only at an achievable rate. I could barely code moving platforms at this point in time.

    Regardless, I made a game, with absolutely no coding experience or experience in Unity, in two and a half months.

    Hello! My name is Mackenzie Burt, I typically go by Kenzie or Kove. I'm a diversified 2D concept artist and
                animator that's pursuing a unique degree called GIMM that focuses on game design! I specialize in making
                characters and stories that people can relate to. My most apparent interest is that of the player community
                itself. I strive to provide and help build projects and interactive content that allows others to not only
                enjoy themselves, but perhaps even learn from the experience they are provided and influence. I think that
                a lot of people these days struggle with mental health, and I truly believe that interactive media and video
                games in general are an incredible way to help people connect with each other and escape the things that
                negatively impact them.
                I'm a very bubbly and positive individual and I particularly enjoy making others laugh. I learn very quickly,
                but the best way for me to learn is getting thrown into the chaos. I thrive with or without structure, and
                tend to work harder when I'm overwhelmed. I've always worked two jobs while going to University full time,
                I can handle a lot of pressure and a lot of tasks. I've typically worked in service my entire life, so socializing
                is something that I enjoy and this is quite helpful in relation to working on projects that require multiple
                people.
                In summary, if you want a social artist with a unique experience and perspective, I'm your girl!
